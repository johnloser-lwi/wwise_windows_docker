<h2>Dynamic range</h2>
<p>Determines the dynamic range or the ratio between the highest and lowest levels in the wind signal that can result from changes in wind speed.</p>
<p>Smaller values result in a compressed dynamic range, which means that changes in wind speed will have a smaller impact on level changes. For the same change in wind speed, larger values will result in a wider range of levels in the wind signal.</p>
<p>Default value: 0.5<br/>
Range: 0 to 1<br/></p>
