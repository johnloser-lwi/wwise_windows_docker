<h2>Roll-off Factor</h2>
<p>Specifies the slope of the attenuation curve, where higher values produce steeper slopes or faster attenuation.</p>
<p>At a value of 1, a -6 dB attenuation is applied each time the deflector&rsquo;s distance is doubled after the Minimum distance. A roll-off of 2 creates a steeper slope that attenuates the deflector twice as fast. A roll-off of 0.5, on the other hand, creates a flatter slope that attenuates the deflector two times slower.</p>

<p>Default value: 1<br/>
Range: 0.0 to 4<br/></p>
