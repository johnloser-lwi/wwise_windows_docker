<h2>Ratio</h2>
<p>The relationship between the input signal and the output signal above a threshold value. This value defines the slope of the output signal above the threshold.</p>
<p>A ratio of 2:1 indicates that for every 2 dB the input signal is above the threshold, only 1 dB will be observed in the output signal. At a ratio of 10:1 and higher, limiting occurs.</p>
<p>Default value: 1.5<br/>
Range: 1 to 50<br/></p>
