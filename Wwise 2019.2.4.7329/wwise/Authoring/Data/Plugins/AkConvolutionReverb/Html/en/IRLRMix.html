<h2>IR Balance</h2>
<p>Balance control can be used to pan a stereo impulse response. This may be useful for impulse responses recorded with more emphasis in one channel, which may result in an undesirable steering of the stereo image (wet component) to one side or the other.</p>
<p>Because the balance control produces a re-mix of the stereo impulse response channels with different weightings, it can also be used with the &lsquo;Mixdown&rsquo; option of the &lsquo;Channels&rsquo; parameter to effectively interpolate between the characteristics of the left and right channels.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This control is only enabled when a stereo impulse response file is used and when the Channels parameter is set to <strong>Stereo</strong> or <strong>Mixdow</strong></p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: -100 to 100<br/></p>
