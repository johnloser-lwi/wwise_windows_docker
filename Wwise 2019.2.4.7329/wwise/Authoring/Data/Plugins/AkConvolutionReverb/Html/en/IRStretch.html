<h2>IR Stretch</h2>
<p>Impulse response resampling factor. This applies a pitch shift effect through resampling (thus affecting its duration). This can be used to simulate smaller or larger spaces by shifting the resonances of the impulse response in frequency. A value of 100 results in no change in duration and frequency. A value of 50 yields a converted impulse response twice as short and with higher resonance frequencies (typical of smaller spaces). A value of 200 yields an impulse response twice as long with lower resonance frequencies (typical of larger spaces).</p>
