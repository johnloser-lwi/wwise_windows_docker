<h2>IR Channels</h2>
<p>Downmix options available for multi-channel impulse responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As Input</strong>: Uses all channels of the impulse response to perform a multi-channel convolution.</li>
<li><strong>Stereo</strong>: Uses a stereo downmix of the impulse response to perform a stereo convolution. Ignored with anonymous channel configurations (falls back to As Input).</li>
<li><strong>Mixdown</strong>: Uses a downmix of all channels of the impulse response to perform a mono convolution with all channels. Anonymous configurations and ambisonics take the first channel / W.</li>
<li><strong>Left only</strong>: Uses the left channel from the impulse response to perform a mono convolution with all channels. Anonymous configurations and ambisonics take the first channel / W.</li>
<li><strong>Right only</strong>: Uses the right channel from the impulse response to perform a mono convolution with all channels. Anonymous configurations and ambisonics take the first channel / W.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This control is only enabled when a multi-channel impulse response file is used.</p>
<p>Default value: As Input<br/></p>
