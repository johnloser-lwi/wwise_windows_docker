<h2>Output Spread</h2>
<p>With standard channel configurations (stereo, 5.1, and so on), Output Spread determines the similarity of the reverberation sent to the left channels (front and/or rear) and right channels (front and/or rear). This can create a stronger/lesser sense of space, by enlarging/narrowing the spread of the reverberation (wet part) of the signal.</p>
<p>When a value of zero is used, the reverberation output to the left and right channels is the same. A value of 180 means that the result of the multi-channel convolution is fed directly to each side.</p>
<p>With ambisonics, the spread is not just lateral (stereo), but instead generalizes to all directions. In effect, it weighs the directional channels compared to the omni channel W.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This effect is stronger when monitored over headphones because of the absence of cross-talk between speaker signals, which diminishes the Effect.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: This property has no effect on 1.0 (mono) or 1.1 channel sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: This property does not apply to the Filter mode.</p>
