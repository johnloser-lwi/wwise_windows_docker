<h2>Density</h2>
<p>Directly modifies the perceived modal density. Lower values often result in a certain amount of ringing while higher settings sound flatter in frequency with a noisy reverb tail.</p>
<p>This property is directly proportional to the amount of memory used by the plug-in because higher modal density is achieved using longer delay lines. These longer delay lines are analogous to larger spaces so this property can sometimes be used to control the perceived room size. This property works closely with the &lsquo;Room shape&rsquo; and &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; properties.</p>
