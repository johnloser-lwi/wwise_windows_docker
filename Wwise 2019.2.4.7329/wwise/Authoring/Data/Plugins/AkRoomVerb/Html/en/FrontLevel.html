<h2>Front Level</h2>
<p>Controls the amount of late reverberation applied to the front left and right channels. This property control does not affect the center channel, which can be controlled explicitly.</p>
<p>This property has no effect in channel configurations where rear channels are not present. In these cases, controlling the wet level (ER + Reverb) is more intuitive.</p>
