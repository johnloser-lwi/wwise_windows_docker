<h2>Filter Cutoff Quantization</h2>
<p>Quantization of modulation applied to Filter Cutoff.</p>
<p>The available quantization schemes for this property are:</p>
<ul>
<li>None: No quantization.</li>
<li>(-1, 1): Quantized to the top and bottom of the modulator waveform.</li>
<li>(-1, 0, 1): Quantized to the top, middle and bottom of the modulator waveform. &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; only applies to bipolar waveforms, and corresponds to the base Filter Cutoff value.</li>
<li>Chromatic: Only semitones (12th of an octave) are allowed. Say the modulation amount is 0.5 (octave), the allowed values are {-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} semitones around the base Filter Cutoff frequency.</li>
<li>Major: Only intervals of the major scale are allowed. Say the modulation amount is 0.5 (octave), the allowed values are {-5, -3, -1, 0, 2, 4, 5} semitones around the base Filter Cutoff frequency.</li>
<li>Minor: Only intervals of the minor scale are allowed. Say the modulation amount is 0.5 (octave), the allowed values are {-5, -4, -2, 0, 2, 3, 5} semitones around the base Filter Cutoff frequency.</li>
<li>Pentatonic: Only intervals of the pentatonic scale are allowed. Say the modulation amount is 0.5 (octave), the allowed values are {-5, -2, 0, 3, 5} semitones around the base Filter Cutoff frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: None<br/></p>
