<p>When <strong>Duration Multiplier</strong> is selected, grain duration is specified as a multiple of the time between emissions. When <strong>Duration</strong> is selected, grain duration is completely independent from the time between emissions. When <strong>MIDI Duration</strong> is selected, and if the synthesizer was spawned from a MIDI note, the note value overrides grain Duration. Modulating the Duration property will modulate <strong>MIDI Duration</strong>.</p>
<p>Default value: Duration Multiplier<br/></p>
