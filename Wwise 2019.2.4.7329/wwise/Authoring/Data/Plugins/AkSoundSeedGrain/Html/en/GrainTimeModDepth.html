<h2>Time Between Emissions Modulation</h2>
<p>Modulation amount applied to Time Between Emissions.</p>
<p>The modulation amount is expressed in number of octaves, above and/or below the original value, depending on the choice of modulator waveshape. One octave up means half the duration, and one octave down means twice the duration. Negative values have the effect of flipping the modulator&rsquo;s output signal (i.e. inverting its polarity).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The value of Time Between Emissions Mod 1 is equivalent to that of Emissions Per Second Mod 1. In other words, if Select Freq/Time was <strong>Frequency</strong>, then the same value would result in the same modulation.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: -10 to 10<br/></p>
