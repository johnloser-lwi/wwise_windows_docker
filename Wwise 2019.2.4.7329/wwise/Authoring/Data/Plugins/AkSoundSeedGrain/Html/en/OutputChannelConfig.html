<h2>Output Config</h2>
<p>Channel configuration forced at the output of the synthesizer.</p>
<p>Using a multichannel output configuration is useful for creating 3D ambiences. To do so, set the positioning of the sound to 3D and set an attenuation ShareSet that uses spread at close distances. Design your synthesizer patch such that the output is maximally enveloping, by using <strong>3D Spatialization</strong> and modulating Azimuth and, if applicable, Elevation. The channel configuration is visible in the Effect&rsquo;s VU Meter during playback with Capture running.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The synthesizer&rsquo;s output signal is further panned or spatialized by Wwise, depending on the sound&rsquo;s positioning settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If changing the output configuration while playing, the new configuration will only be effective the next time the synthesizer is played.</p>
<p>Default value: Mono<br/></p>
