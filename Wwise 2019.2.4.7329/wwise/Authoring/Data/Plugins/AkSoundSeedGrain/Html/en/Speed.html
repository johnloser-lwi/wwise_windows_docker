<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>Playback speed of grains.</p>
<ul>
<li>With a speed of 1, grains play at the same speed as the original sound.</li>
<li>With speeds greater than 1, they play faster than the original sound, and thus at a higher pitch.</li>
<li>With speeds lower than 1, but positive, they play slower than the original sound, and thus at a lower pitch.</li>
<li>With negative speeds, they play backwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effective speed at which grains play also depends on grain Pitch.</p>
<p>Default value: 1<br/>
Range: -4 to 4<br/></p>
