<h2>Duration Multiplier</h2>
<p>Grain duration, expressed as a multiplication factor of the emission rate (set using either Emissions per Second or Time Between Emissions). This control is only available when Duration Link is set to Duration Multiplier.</p>
<p>When set to 1, actual grain duration is equal to the time that elapses between each grain, with envelope release overlapping envelope attack, resulting in a continuous dovetailing of grains. When smaller than 1, gaps will exist between grains; when greater than 1, grains stack up.</p>
<p>Default value: 1<br/>
Range: 0.001 to 1000<br/></p>
