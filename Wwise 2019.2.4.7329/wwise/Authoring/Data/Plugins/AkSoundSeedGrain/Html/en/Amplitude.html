<h2>Amplitude</h2>
<p>Amplitude of grains, in percent.</p>
<p>This control is useful when assigned with a modulator, in order to vary the relative level of grains.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the effective amplitude goes below zero, the perceived amplitude goes back up, but the signal is 180 degrees out of phase.</p>
<p>Default value: 100<br/>
Range: 0 to 100<br/></p>
