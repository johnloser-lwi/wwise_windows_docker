<h2>Select Freq/Time</h2>
<p>Select whether you want to control the grain emission frequency (<strong>Emissions per Second</strong>), the time between each grain is emitted (<strong>Time Between Emissions</strong>) or to control the grain emission frequency from a MIDI note (<strong>MIDI Emissions per Second</strong>).</p>
<p>When <strong>MIDI Emissions Per Second</strong> is chosen, and if the synthesizer was spawned from a MIDI note, the note value overrides Emissions per Second. Modulating the Emissions per Second property will modulate this value.</p>
<p>Default value: Time between Emissions<br/></p>
