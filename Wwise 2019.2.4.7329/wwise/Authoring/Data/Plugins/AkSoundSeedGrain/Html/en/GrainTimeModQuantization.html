<h2>Time Between Emissions Quantization</h2>
<p>Quantization of modulation applied to Time Between Emissions.</p>
<p>The available quantization schemes for this property are:</p>
<ul>
<li>None: No quantization.</li>
<li>(-1, 1): Quantized to the top and bottom of the modulator waveform.</li>
<li>(-1, 0, 1): Quantized to the top, middle, and bottom of the modulator waveform. &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; only applies to bipolar waveforms and corresponds to the base Time Between Emissions value.</li>
<li>Chromatic: Only semitones (12th of an octave) are allowed. Say the modulation amount is 0.5 octave, the allowed values are {-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} semitones around the base Time Between Emissions duration (see note below).</li>
<li>Major: Only intervals of the major scale are allowed. Say the modulation amount is 0.5 octave, the allowed values are {-5, -3, -1, 0, 2, 4, 5} semitones around the base Time Between Emissions duration (see note below).</li>
<li>Minor: Only intervals of the minor scale are allowed. Say the modulation amount is 0.5 octave, the allowed values are {-5, -4, -2, 0, 2, 3, 5} semitones around the base Time Between Emissions duration (see note below).</li>
<li>Pentatonic: Only intervals of the pentatonic scale are allowed. Say the modulation amount is 0.5 octave, the allowed values are {-5, -2, 0, 3, 5} semitones around the base Time Between Emissions duration (see note below).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Time Between Emissions modulation is equivalent to Emissions per Second modulation. Thus, same values of modulation result in the same behavior. Here, modulating one octave down is equivalent to stretching time by a factor of 2. Similarly, modulating one semitone down is equivalent to stretching time by 2 to the power of 1/12, that is, by a factor of 1.059.</p>
<p>Default value: None<br/></p>
