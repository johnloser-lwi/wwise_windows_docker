<h2>Amplitude Modulation</h2>
<p>Modulation amount applied to Amplitude.</p>
<p>The modulation amount is expressed in percentage, above and/or below the original value, depending on the choice of modulator waveshape. Negative values have the effect of flipping the modulator&rsquo;s output signal (i.e. inverting its polarity).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: With a bipolar modulator it is possible to go under 0. For example, -50% plays a grain at 50% of the original level, but with the signal&rsquo;s polarity inverted.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: 0 to 100<br/></p>
