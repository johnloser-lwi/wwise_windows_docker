<h2>Duration Modulation</h2>
<p>Modulation amount applied to Duration.</p>
<p>The modulation amount is expressed in number of octaves, above and/or below the original value, depending on the choice of modulator waveshape. One octave up means half the duration, and one octave down means twice the duration. Negative values have the effect of flipping the modulator&rsquo;s output signal (i.e. inverting its polarity).</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: -10 to 10<br/></p>
