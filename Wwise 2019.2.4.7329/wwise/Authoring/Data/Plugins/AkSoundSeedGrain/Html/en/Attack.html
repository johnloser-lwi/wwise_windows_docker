<h2>Attack</h2>
<p>Attack time of the grain envelope, in ms. When Window Mode is <strong>Release Same as Attack</strong>, the Release time is equal to Attack time.</p>
<p>The Attack envelope starts at the beginning of the grain and is therefore comprised in the grain&rsquo;s duration, as opposed to the envelope&rsquo;s release portion (Release), which starts at the end of the grain.</p>
<p>You may also change the Attack time using the upper-left handle in the grain visualizer window.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the Attack time is longer than the grain&rsquo;s duration, the grain will not play at full volume but, instead, at the envelope level that was applied when the Attack was truncated.</p>
<p>Default value: 10<br/>
Range: 0 to 5000<br/></p>
