<h2>Filter Gain</h2>
<p>The amount of the amplification of the transposed (wet) signal for the selected frequency band. Increasing this value &ldquo;boosts&rdquo; the audio signal. Decreasing this value &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; or attenuates the audio signal.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Gain controls are not available when the Low Pass, High Pass, Notch, and Band Pass curves have been selected because these filter types have their passband normalized at 0 dB.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: -24 to 24<br/>
Units: dB<br/></p>
