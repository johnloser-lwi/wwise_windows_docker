<h2>Apply Downstream Volume</h2>
<p>When enabled, the meter will display volume gains applied at a higher level. For example, if the volume of the Master Audio Bus is increased by 10 and that of a child Audio Bus is decreased by 15, then all its children will inherit the sum total gain of -5. Although the gain is always audible, unless this option is enabled the meter will normally not show it.</p>
