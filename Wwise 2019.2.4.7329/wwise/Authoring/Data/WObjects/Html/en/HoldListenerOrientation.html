<h2>Hold Listener Orientation</h2>
<p>Determines whether the position of the animation path is locked to the orientation of the listener.</p>
<p>When this option is not selected, the path moves with the listener. This means that the sound will always be heard through the same speakers regardless of the orientation of the listener. When selected, the listener moves independently of the path. This means that the sound will be heard through different speakers as the listener turns around.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you are using automation around the listener to create non-localized bird sounds in your game. You have a one-point path that is located in the front-right quadrant. As the listener turns around in game, the following will occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Listener Orientation (OFF) - The bird sound will always be heard through the front right speaker.</li>
<li>Hold Listener Orientation (ON) - The bird sound will pass through different speakers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This option can be useful for creating non-localized ambient sounds.</p>
<p>This option can only be tested in game because the listener concept has not been integrated into the Wwise authoring application.</p>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
