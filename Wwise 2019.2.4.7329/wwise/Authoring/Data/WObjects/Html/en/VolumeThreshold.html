<h2>Volume Threshold</h2>
<p>The default volume level below which a voice will be managed by behaviors defined in the Advanced Settings tab of the Property Editor. For example, voices that fall below the volume threshold can do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to play</li>
<li>Be killed</li>
<li><span class="condition" name="Feature_VirtualVoice">Sent to the virtual voice list</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This value can be overridden by using the Wwise SDK API.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Even if it continues to play or becomes virtual, the voice will be inaudible while it is still below the volume threshold.
<strong>Note</strong>: The default slider range is from -96 to 0. You can go over those limits by entering the value directly, or by rolling the mouse while the focus is on the edit control.</p>
<p>Default value: -80<br/>
Range: -96 to 0<br/></p>
