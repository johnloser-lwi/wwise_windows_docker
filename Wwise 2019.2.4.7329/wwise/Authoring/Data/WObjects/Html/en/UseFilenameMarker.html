<h2>Insert filename marker</h2>
<p>Determines whether a marker with the name of the file is created at the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>This can be useful to bind an action to a particular file in the sound engine, for example when lip-syncing.</p>
<p>The marker only contains the filename and not the file&rsquo;s path and extension.</p>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
