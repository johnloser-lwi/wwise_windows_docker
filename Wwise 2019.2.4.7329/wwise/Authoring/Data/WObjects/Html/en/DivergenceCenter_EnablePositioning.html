<h2>Center %</h2>
<p>The amount or percentage of volume that is passed through the center speaker.</p>
<ul>
<li>For speaker panning with Direct Assignment, the Center % value applies only for mono objects output to a bus with a center channel. Actor-Mixer objects are mono when their underlying source file or plug-in is mono. Master-Mixer objects (busses) are mono when their Channel Configuration is set to 1.0.</li>
<li>For speaker panning with Balance-Fade applied, the Center % value applies only for output with a center channel (such as mono, 3.0, 5.1, and 7.1).</li>
<li>For 3D spatialization, the Center % value also applies only for output with a center channel; but, moreover, it needs to be set in order to have a signal sent to the center channel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: For more information on using the Center %, refer to <a href="HelpDoc=routing_audio_signals_to_center_speaker">Routing Audio Signals to the Center Speaker</a>.</p>
