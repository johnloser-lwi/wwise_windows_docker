<h2>Voice Low-pass Filter</h2>
<p>A recursive filter that attenuates high frequencies based on the value specified.</p>
<p>The units for this filter represent the percentage of low-pass filtering that has been applied, where 0 means no low-pass filtering (signal unaffected) and 100 means maximal attenuation.</p>
<p>(For more detail, see <a href="HelpDoc=associating_low_pass_filter_values_with_their_corresponding_cutoff_frequencies">Associating Low-pass and High-pass Filter Values with their Corresponding Cutoff Frequencies</a>.)</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: 0 to 100<br/></p>
