<h2>Noise Level</h2>
<p>Level applied to output of noise module, in dB. The level is applied before the output of the noise module is mixed with the combined oscillator outputs.</p>
<p>Note that setting the noise level to -96 bypasses all associated noise computations, improving performance.</p>
<p>Default value: -96.0<br/>
Range: -96.0 to 24.0<br/>
Units: dB<br/></p>
