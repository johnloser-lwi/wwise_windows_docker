<h2>Distance Threshold</h2>
<p>When in step threshold mode, sets the minimum change in ray distance (in game units) needed to update the reflection delay time. When set to 0, reflections are crossfaded with movement. This value will not be updated if the reflect length/delay is actively changing. This parameter can be controlled by RTPCs and States; but, updating of the RTPC or State during game play is not recommended. Real-time updates are honored but not guaranteed to be handled without artifacts.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: 0 to 2147483648<br/></p>
