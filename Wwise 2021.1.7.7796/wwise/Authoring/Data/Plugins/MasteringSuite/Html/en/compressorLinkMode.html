<h2>Compressor Link Mode</h2>
<p>Specifies the mode used for applying compression with regards to channels. If the Mastering Suite is working with object-based audio, the Link Mode is set to &lsquo;All channels&rsquo; at all time and overrides any user-defined setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>No link: Compression is applied to each channel individually</li>
<li>All channels: The maximum compression is applied equally to all channels</li>
<li>Partial link: Uses the value of Link Strength to control compression of channels, applying the maximum compression to the corresponding channel and applying the Link Strength ratio to that maximum for other channels</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: All channels<br/></p>
