<h2>Anchor</h2>
<p>Determines whether the moving object spins or turns around a given deflector. Specifying an anchor point allows deflector samples to encounter wind at different air velocities. If no anchor is defined, then all deflector samples are assumed to be moving at the same speed.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we have an object with three deflectors, where the first deflector is defined as the anchor point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deflector</strong> 1: No speed.</li>
<li><strong>Deflector 2</strong>: Travels at half the speed of deflector 3.</li>
<li><strong>Deflector 3</strong>: Travels at full speed, which is defined defined by the Object speed property value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
