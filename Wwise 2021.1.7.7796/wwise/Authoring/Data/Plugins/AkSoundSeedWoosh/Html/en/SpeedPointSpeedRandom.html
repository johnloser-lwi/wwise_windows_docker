<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>An absolute offset applied to the time property value for each point along the curve. This defines a range of possible time values for each point. For example, adding a random value of 1 to the property value would mean that the possible time value for each point would be [(value - 1) to (value +1)].</p>
<p>When defining a Random value, Wwise randomly selects a value from within the range (value +/- random) for each point along the curve each time the woosh sound is played. This has the effect of shifting each point on the curve independently, either left or right.</p>
<p>The points order cannot change which preserves the contour of the curve. As a result, each point can move randomly between the previous and next point.</p>
