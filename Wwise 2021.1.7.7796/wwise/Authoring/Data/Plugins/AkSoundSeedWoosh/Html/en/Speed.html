<h2>Object Speed</h2>
<p>The average velocity at which the fastest-traveling deflector travels through the air. The fastest traveling deflector is the one farthest from the anchor point, if there is one.</p>
<p>Object speed is interpreted in terms of an offset in energy applied to the deflectors in a scene. This property basically defines the effect speed has on the deflectors&rsquo; resonating frequencies.</p>
<p>By default, the Automate option is selected for the Object Speed property. The automation curve contains the following three points (t=0, 0), (t=0.25, 100), (t=0.5, 0).</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: -50.0 to 50.0<br/></p>
