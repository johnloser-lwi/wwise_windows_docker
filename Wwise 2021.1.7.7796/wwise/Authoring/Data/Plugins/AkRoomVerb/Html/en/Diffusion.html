<h2>Diffusion</h2>
<p>Directly controls the echo density characteristic of the reverb. A lower Diffusion value will sometimes result in a shrilling sound where each echo can be distinctively perceived. Higher Diffusion values give a denser reverberation tail. Higher diffusion also means that transient signals are blurred in time with their energy spread over some interval of time. the effect of this property will be noticeable mostly on materials with sharp transients, for example, snare drum hits.</p>
