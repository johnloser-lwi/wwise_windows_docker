<h2>ER Room Size</h2>
<p>Determines the time scaling applied to the ER pattern.</p>
<p>A value of zero means there is no time scaling of the ER pattern selected, a value of 100 yields a doubling of the time taken before receiving each early reflection, and a value of -100 halves the time taken by the ER pattern chosen. Note that the time of the first early reflection is a good perceptual cue of the size of the acoustical space modeled.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: -100 to 100<br/></p>
