<h2>Pre Delay</h2>
<p>Specifies the time between the direct sound and the start of the dense reverb tail. While pre delay supports exclusive RTPC, it should only be used for initialization, before playback. If an RTPC is used to change pre delay in real time during playback, the delay buffer will be continuously re-initialized, which will cause sudden silences or changes in the reverb signal.</p>
