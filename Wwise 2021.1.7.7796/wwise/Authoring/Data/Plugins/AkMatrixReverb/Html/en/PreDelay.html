<h2>Pre-delay</h2>
<p>The delay that occurs before the signal enters the reverberation unit. A longer pre-delay time can be used to simulate larger rooms where the first echoes take longer to be heard. The first reflection will be heard at a time interval based on the sum of the pre-delay time and the shortest of the delay lines specified for the reverb. While pre-delay supports exclusive RTPC, it should only be used for initialization, before playback. If an RTPC is used to change pre-delay in real time during playback, the delay buffer will be continuously re-initialized, which will cause sudden silences or changes in the reverb signal.</p>
