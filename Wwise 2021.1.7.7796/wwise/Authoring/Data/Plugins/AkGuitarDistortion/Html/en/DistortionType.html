<h2>Type</h2>
<p>The type of distortion algorithm that will be applied. The following options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>None</strong>: No distortion will be applied.</li>
<li><strong>Overdrive</strong>: Smooth, blues type distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy</strong>: Hard distortion introducing lots of high frequency harmonics.</li>
<li><strong>Clip</strong>: Hard clipping with no transition. Often leads to unpleasant static noise (clipping distortion).</li>
<li><strong>Fuzz</strong>: Asymmetrical hard and soft clipping with different thresholds for positive and negative values. This type of distortion introduces many harmonics and may quickly sound inharmonic with complex tonal input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: None<br/></p>
