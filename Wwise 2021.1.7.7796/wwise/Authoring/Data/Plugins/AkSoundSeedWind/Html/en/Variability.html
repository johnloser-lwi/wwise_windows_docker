<h2>Variability</h2>
<p>The amount by which the wind speed can change due to wind gusts.</p>
<p>SoundSeed Wind yields optimal results when property values evolve slowly. As a result, using high variability values in combination with high gustiness and Q factor values will most likely produce undesirable results.</p>
<p>Default value: 0.25<br/>
Range: 0.0 to 1.0<br/></p>
