<h2>Duration Random</h2>
<p>A positive and negative offset applied to the Duration property value that defines a range of possible values. For example, if you have the Duration set to 10 and the Duration random set 5, this would mean that the possible range for the Duration would be (5 to 15) or [(Duration value - 5) to (Duration value +5)].</p>
<p>When you define a Duration random value, Wwise will randomly select a value from within the range (value +/- random) each time the wind sound is played. For looping sounds, every iteration will have a randomized duration.</p>
