<h2>Volume (to Output Bus)</h2>
<p>The attenuation or amplitude of the signal routed to the audio output bus.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The default slider range is from -96 to +12. You can go over those limits by entering the value directly, or by rolling the mouse while the focus is on the edit control.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: When using the User-Defined Auxiliary Sends in a wet/dry mix scenario, the Output Bus Volume would be associated with the dry level, as opposed to the auxiliary send volume, which would relate to the wet level. Use an RTPC on Output Bus Volume and Auxiliary Send Volumes to control the balance from the game.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: -200 to 200<br/>
Units: dB<br/></p>
