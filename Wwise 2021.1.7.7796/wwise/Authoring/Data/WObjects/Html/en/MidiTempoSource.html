<p>Determines the tempo used to play a MIDI clip.</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchy</strong>-the tempo is obtained from the time settings of the clip&rsquo;s ancestors.</p>
<p><strong>File</strong>-the tempo is obtained from the clip&rsquo;s original MIDI file.</p>
<p>Note that this setting is used when creating a MIDI clip to determine its duration. Changing this field after the clip is created changes the tempo used to interpret the clip, but does not change the clip&rsquo;s duration. To change a MIDI clip&rsquo;s duration, use the clip handles.</p>
<p>Default value: Hierarchy<br/></p>
