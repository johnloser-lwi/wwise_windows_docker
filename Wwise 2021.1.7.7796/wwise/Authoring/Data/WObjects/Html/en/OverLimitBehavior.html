<h2>When limit is reached:</h2>
<p>Determines what happens when the playback limit is reached. You can select one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kill voice for lowest priority:</strong> Stops playing instance with the lowest priority. When an object is killed, a small fade out of a few milliseconds is performed.</li>
<li><strong>Use virtual voice settings for lowest priority:</strong> Sets the sound with the lowest priority to adopt its virtual voice behavior. Refer to the <strong>Virtual voice behavior</strong> section in this table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that each entity can override its own behavior so that the virtual behavior of a sound can still be to discard the sound or to continue to play.</p>
<p>Default value: Kill voice<br/></p>
