<h2>Release Time</h2>
<p>Defines the rate at which the HDR window falls back to rest when the target is below the current value.</p>
<p>In Linear Mode (see below), it is the time in seconds it takes to drop by approximately 10 decibels.</p>
<p>In Exponential Mode, it is the time in seconds it takes to reach approximately 0.37 (1/e) of the difference between the target and the current value.</p>
