<h2>Duration</h2>
<p>The length of the crossfades or delay between clips. If Trigger rate is selected as the transition type, the duration defines the amount of time that will pass before the next sound is triggered.</p>
<p>The Duration slider is unavailable when the Sample Accurate option is selected.</p>
<p>The maximum duration of a crossfade is equal to half the duration of the sound. In cases where the crossfade time is longer than half the duration of the sound, the crossfade duration is automatically adjusted to the maximum allowed. This automatic adjustment is performed by the sound engine at run time. Wwise does not limit or indicate that the crossfade time is too long for some of the sounds in the container.</p>
<p>Default value: 1<br/>
Range: 0 to 3600<br/></p>
