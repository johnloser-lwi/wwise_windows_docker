<h2>LR Mix</h2>
<p>The power level of the signal that is passed through the left and right speakers, where &#60; C &#62; represents an equal distribution of power through both speakers.</p>
<p>The L-R Mix control only applies when converting mono sounds to stereo and vice versa. For all other conversions, the mix is determined by Wwise. For more information on how Wwise handles the L-R mix, refer to <a href="HelpDoc=creating_audio_conversion_settings_sharesets#about_audio_channels">About Audio Channels</a>.</p>
