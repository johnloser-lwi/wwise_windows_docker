<h2>Maximum</h2>
<p>The maximum amount of in-game memory that you want to allocate for a particular SoundBank.</p>
<p>This value can be unlinked so that the maximum size can be different for each platform.</p>
<p>You can successfully generate a SoundBank even though it exceeds the maximum memory that you allocated.</p>
<p>A value of 0 means there is no limit on the size of this SoundBank. In this case the control displays &ldquo;Infinite&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;0&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
Range: 0 to 2147483647<br/>
Units: B <br/></p>
