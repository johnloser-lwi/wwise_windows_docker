<h2>Enable Envelope</h2>
<p>When enabled, the HDR window follows the analyzed envelope of the loudest sound (if it is above threshold). It is also used to determine if the sound is within its active range (see the Active Range property below).</p>
<p>When it is disabled, the envelope of the sound is not considered for computing the window top.</p>

<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
