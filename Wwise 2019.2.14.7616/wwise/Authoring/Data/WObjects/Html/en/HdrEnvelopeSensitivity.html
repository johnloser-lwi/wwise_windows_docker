<h2>HDR Envelope Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Defines the Envelope Sensitivity used in the algorithm to reduce the number of points in the Envelope.</p>
<ul>
<li>One point is always kept along the points at the two extremities.</li>
<li>At 0, no other points are kept.</li>
<li>At 100, all points are kept.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sensitivity is used until the Envelope is edited by hand.</p>
