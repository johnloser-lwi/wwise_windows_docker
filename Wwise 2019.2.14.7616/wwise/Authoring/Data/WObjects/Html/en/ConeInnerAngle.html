<h2>Inner angle</h2>
<p>The angle that defines an area where no attenuation occurs.</p>
<p>The inner angle defines the top boundary in the mini cone display. It is redrawn in real time as the value is modified.</p>
<p>The area between the inner and outer angle is called the transition area. The volume attenuation within this area is linearly interpolated between zero attenuation and the max attenuation value.</p>
<p>Default value: 90<br/>
Range: 0 to 360<br/>
Units: Â° <br/></p>
