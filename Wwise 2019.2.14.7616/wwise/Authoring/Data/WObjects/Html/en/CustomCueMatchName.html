<h2>Custom cue match name</h2>
<p>Determines which custom cues are eligible to be selected as the &lsquo;Play At&rsquo; position. If no name is specified, any custom cue will match.</p>
<p>String comparison is not case-sensitive, but it must be exact (there is no wildcard).</p>
<p>This option can only be used when &lsquo;Play At&rsquo; is set to &lsquo;Next Cue&rsquo; or &lsquo;Next Custom Cue&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Name matching affects the selection of custom cues only; it has no effect on the eligibility of the entry or exit cues.</p>
