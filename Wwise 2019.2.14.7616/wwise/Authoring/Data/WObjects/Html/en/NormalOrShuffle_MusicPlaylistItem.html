<h2>Random type</h2>
<p>Defines whether a group uses standard or shuffle mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard</strong>: Keeps the pool of objects within the container intact. After an object is played, it is not removed from the possible list of objects that can be played and can therefore be repeated.</li>
<li><strong>Shuffle</strong>: Removes objects from the pool after they have been played. This option avoids repetition of sounds until all objects have been played. The last object played cannot be repeated when the list is reset.</li>
</ul>
<p>The option applies to Random Groups only.</p>
<p>Default value: Standard<br/></p>
