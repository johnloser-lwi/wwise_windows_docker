<h2>Apply dither</h2>
<p>Applies dithering to the bit rate conversion of the audio source.</p>
<p>Dither is the noise added to a signal prior to quantization in order to reduce the distortion and noise modulation that results from the quantization process. Dithering is only applied when the resolution changes, for example, from 16 bits to 8.</p>
<p>If you deselect this option, dithering will not be applied. This option is enabled by default.</p>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
