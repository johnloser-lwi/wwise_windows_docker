<h2>HDR Release Time Mode</h2>
<p>Defines the behavior when the window releases to a lower value.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Linear Mode</strong>, the window top moves linearly in the dB scale (that is, exponentially in the linear scale).</li>
<li>In <strong>Exponential Mode</strong>, it moves exponentially in the dB scale. The speed at which it does depends on the Release Time (see above).</li>
</ul>

<p>Default value: Exponential<br/></p>
