<h2>Seek To Nearest Marker</h2>
<p>The effective seek position will snap to the nearest marker. Markers are embedded into wave files and preserved when they are imported in Wwise.</p>
<p>When seeking within Music Segments though, this option will snap the effective position to the nearest Segment Custom Cue, or Segment Entry Cue, as authored in the Segment Editor. The Exit Cue is always ignored.</p>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
