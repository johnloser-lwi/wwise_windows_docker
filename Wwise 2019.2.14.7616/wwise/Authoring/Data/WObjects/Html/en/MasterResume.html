<p>Clears all pause actions applied to the associated Wwise object.</p>
<p>If selected, all pause Actions applied to the Wwise object are removed, causing the Wwise object to resume playback. If unselected, only one pause Action will be removed, leaving the other pause Actions intact.</p>
<p>When several pause Actions have been applied to an object, a simple Resume Action will not resume playback of the object. To force playback, you must use the Master resume option.</p>
