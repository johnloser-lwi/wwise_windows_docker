<h2>Playback rate</h2>
<p>A factor applied to the duration property value that determines the rate at which the wind sound is played back. For example, a value of 2 will render the synthesized sound 2 times faster, which makes the sound twice as short.</p>
<p>This option can be useful when you want the automation curve to be read at dynamic rates which follow a Game Parameter that the game cycles through at a variable speed. For example, imagine that a character in the game takes a potion which slows down time by a factor of two; then, cycling through automation curves with a playback rate of 0.5 would keep all air sounds in sync with the game&rsquo;s time flow.</p>
<p>Default value: 1.0<br/>
Range: 0.1 to 10.0<br/></p>
