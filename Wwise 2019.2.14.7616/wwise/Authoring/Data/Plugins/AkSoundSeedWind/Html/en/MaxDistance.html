<h2>Maximum Distance</h2>
<p>Defines the maximum dimensions of the wind scene.</p>
<p>The maximum distance is represented in the graph view by the outer circle. Since the outer circle is fixed in place, when you change the maximum distance value, the minimum distance circle will be resized accordingly.</p>
<p>Although the deflectors in your scene do not appear to move when modifying the Maximum distance value, their positions are actually scaled in relation to the maximum distance value.</p>
<p>Default value: 10.0<br/>
Range: 1.0 to 100.0<br/></p>
