<h2>Pre-delay</h2>
<p>The delay that occurs before the signal enters the reverberation unit. A longer pre-delay time can be used to simulate larger rooms where the first echoes take longer to be heard. The first reflection will be heard at a time interval based on the sum of the pre-delay time and the shortest of the delay lines specified for the reverb.</p>
