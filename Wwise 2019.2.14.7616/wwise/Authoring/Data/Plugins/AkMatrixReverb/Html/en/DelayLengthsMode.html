<h2>Delay Lengths Mode</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default delay lengths</strong>: Specifies that the delay length&rsquo;s default settings will be used.</li>
<li><strong>Custom delay lengths</strong>: Specifies that a matrix comprised of individual delay lengths for each delay line will be used to change the &ldquo;color&rdquo; of the reverb and to add artistic effects. Longer delay lines increase the modal density of the reverb but also increase the memory usage, and decreases the echo density.</li>
</ul>
