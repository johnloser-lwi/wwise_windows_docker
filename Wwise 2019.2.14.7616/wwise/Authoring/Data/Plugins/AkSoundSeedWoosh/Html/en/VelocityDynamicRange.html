<h2>Dynamic Range</h2>
<p>Determines the dynamic range or the ratio between the highest and lowest levels in the woosh signal that can result from changes in object speed.</p>
<p>Smaller values result in a compressed dynamic range, which means that changes in object speed will have a smaller impact on level changes. For the same change in woosh speed, larger values will result in a wider range of levels in the woosh signal.</p>
<p>Default value: 1<br/>
Range: 0 to 1<br/></p>
