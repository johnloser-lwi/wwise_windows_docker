<h2>Noise Color</h2>
<p>Determines the spectral tilt of the synthesized woosh signal. You can select any one of the following colors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White noise</strong> - Produces a signal with no spectral tilt.</li>
<li><strong>Pink noise</strong> - Produces a signal with a -3 dB per octave spectral tilt. This results in a negative slope where less emphasis is placed on the higher frequencies.</li>
<li><strong>Red noise</strong> - Produces a signal with a -6 dB per octave spectral tilt. This results in a steeper negative slope where even less emphasis than pink noise is placed on the higher frequencies.</li>
<li><strong>Purple noise</strong> - Produces a +6 dB per octave tilt. This results in a positive slope where emphasis is placed on the higher frequencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: White<br/></p>
