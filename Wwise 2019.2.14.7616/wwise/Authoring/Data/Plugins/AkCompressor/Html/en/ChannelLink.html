<p>Applies the same gain reduction to all channels. This is implemented by taking the RMS power in the signal of all channels. The threshold is set by scaling the power in dB for the number of channels that are linked.</p>
<p>If this option is not selected, no information is shared between channels, and the Effect is applied on a per-channel basis.</p>
