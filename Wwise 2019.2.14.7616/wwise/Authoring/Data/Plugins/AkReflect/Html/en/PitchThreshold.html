<h2>Pitch Threshold</h2>
<p>When in continuous threshold mode, sets the maximum allowable Doppler pitch shift (in cents) before ducking reflection volume. When set to 0, reflection&rsquo;s volume are ducked with movement. This value will not be updated if the reflect length/delay is actively changing. This parameter can be controlled by RTPCs and States; but, updating of the RTPC or State during game play is not recommended. Real-time updates are honored but not guaranteed to be handled without artifacts.</p>
<p>Default value: 2400<br/>
Range: 0 to 9600<br/></p>
