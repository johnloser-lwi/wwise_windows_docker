<h2>Apply Downstream Volume</h2>
<p>When enabled, the gains applied at a higher level will apply to the output file. For example, if the volume of the Master Audio Bus is increased by 10 and that of a child Audio Bus is decreased by 15, then the child and all its children will inherit the sum total gain of -5. Although the gain is always audible, unless this option is enabled the audio file output by the recorder will not include it.</p>
