<h2>Ambisonic Channel Ordering</h2>
<p>For ambisonic channel configurations, this setting can be used to switch between FuMa ordering and ACN ordering (AmbiX).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For ambisonic order above 3, this setting is ignored and files are always AmbiX, because FuMa is not defined above 3rd order.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: By default, Wwise considers imported ambisonic files to be FuMa when the order is below or equal to 3, and AmbiX above. Therefore, when this setting is set to FuMa, ambisonic files of any order will be properly imported into Wwise.</p>
<p>Default value: FuMa<br/></p>
