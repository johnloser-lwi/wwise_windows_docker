<h2>Mode</h2>
<p>The type of secondary detection used to create various limiting styles to suit a variety of input signals and applications. You have the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clean</strong> - The most transparent limiter mode. Signal levels are adjusted with the least amount of measurable distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Soft</strong> - Sightly louder than the Clean mode, however, also very transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Smart</strong> - Intelligent limiting minimizing signal distortion while increasing signal levels more than the Soft mode.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> - Louder than the Smart mode, and adding a hint of compression pumping under certain conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Loud</strong> - As loud as possible while keeping signal distortion minimal.</li>
<li><strong>Crush</strong> - Louder than the Loud mode, with some signal distortion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: Clean<br/></p>
