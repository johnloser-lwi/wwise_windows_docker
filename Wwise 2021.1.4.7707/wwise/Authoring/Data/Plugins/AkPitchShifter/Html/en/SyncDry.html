<h2>Delay Dry</h2>
<p>Determines whether the dry signal should be delayed to preserve synchronization with the transposed signal (wet path).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This property has no effect when the pitch shifter is used in an Auxiliary Bus. In this case, the dry signal is defined by the object sending to the Auxiliary Bus.</p>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
