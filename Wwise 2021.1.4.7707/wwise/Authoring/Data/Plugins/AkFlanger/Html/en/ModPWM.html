<h2>LFO PWM</h2>
<p>Applies to the square waveform only. Modulates the width of the pulse during one cycle. At 50%, the signal is at its full amplitude for half of the cycle, and is 0 for the other half. Near 100%, the signal is at its full amplitude for almost all the cycle, while it drops to 0 for a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>Default value: 50<br/>
