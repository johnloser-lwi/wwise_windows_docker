<h2>Quality</h2>
<p>Determines the number of reverberation units used by the algorithm. A higher Quality value can help change the audio quality of the reverberation significantly but will result in a proportional increase in CPU usage.</p>
<p>If you increase Quality, you may want to reduce the Density and the reverse is also true. Lower Quality values, such as 2, often do not provide the necessary echo density for realistic reverberation. Higher Quality values may produce the effect of more reflective rooms.</p>
<p>Default value: 8<br/>
Range: 2 to 16<br/>
Units: Reverberations <br/></p>
