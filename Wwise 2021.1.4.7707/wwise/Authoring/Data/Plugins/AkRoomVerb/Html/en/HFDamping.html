<h2>HF Damping</h2>
<p>A roll-off factor used to control the reverberation time for high frequencies relative to low frequencies.</p>
<p>When the value of this ratio is less than 1, the high frequency reverberation time becomes longer than that for lower frequencies.</p>
<p>Default value: 2.25<br/>
Range: 0.5 to 10<br/></p>
