<h2>Filter Band Curve</h2>
<p>Determines the type of filtering that can be applied to the signal. The following filters are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low shelf</strong> - Boosts or cuts the lower-level frequencies while leaving high frequencies unaffected.</li>
<li><strong>Peaking</strong> - Boosts or cuts a specific frequency region while leaving lower and higher frequencies unaffected. The width of this frequency region can be controlled using the Q property.</li>
<li><strong>High shelf</strong> - Boosts or cuts the higher-level frequencies while leaving low frequencies unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: High shelf<br/></p>
