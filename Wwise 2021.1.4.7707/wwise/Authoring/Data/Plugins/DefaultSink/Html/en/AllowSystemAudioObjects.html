<h2>Allow System Audio Objects</h2>
<p>When 3D audio is activated, selecting this option allows the Audio Device to send System Audio Objects to the endpoint if the endpoint supports a number of Audio Objects greater than the specified threshold, (i.e., the value of <strong>Minimum System Audio Objects Required</strong>).</p>
<p>Deselect this option to opt out of sending individual System Audio Objects.</p>
<p>When deselected, Audio Objects are mixed to the Main Mix, while keeping their spatial characteristics. The resulting spatial accuracy will depend on the configuration of the Main Mix.</p>
<p>Default value: true<br/></p>
