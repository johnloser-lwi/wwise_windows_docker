<h2>Max Distance</h2>
<p>The distance from the emitting source where the sound/motion reaches its lowest level. The attenuation of the object remains constant beyond the max distance.</p>
<p>Sound and motion propagation is omni-directional, so the max distance value creates a spherical boundary around the emitting source.</p>
<p>The max distance is represented in the Graph view by the last control point.</p>
<p>(Wwise distance units will match the distance units that you are using in game, for example, centimeters, meters, and so on.)</p>
<p>Default value: 100.0<br/>
Range: 1 to 100000000<br/>
Units: Wwise distance units. <br/></p>
