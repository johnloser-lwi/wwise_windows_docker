<h2>Communication Port Discovery Broadcast</h2>
<p>Port that is opened on the game side. The authoring application broadcasts Game Discovery messages to that port, so it is important to use the same port in the game and in your Wwise project. Since both the game and the authoring application need to know about this port, it cannot be dynamic (cannot be set to 0).</p>
