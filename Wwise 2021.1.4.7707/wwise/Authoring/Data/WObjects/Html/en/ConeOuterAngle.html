<h2>Outer angle</h2>
<p>The angle that defines the area where Volume, Low-Pass Filter, Spread, and Focus Attenuation remain at their maximum levels.</p>
<p>The outer angle defines the bottom boundary in the mini cone display. It is redrawn in real time as the value is modified.</p>
<p>The area between the inner and outer angle is called the transition area. The volume attenuation within this area is linearly interpolated between zero attenuation and the max attenuation value.</p>
<p>Default value: 245<br/>
Range: 0 to 360<br/>
Units: Â° <br/></p>
