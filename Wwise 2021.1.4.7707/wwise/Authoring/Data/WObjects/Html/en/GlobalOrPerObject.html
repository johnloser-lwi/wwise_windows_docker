<h2>Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global</strong>: All instances of the container used in the game are treated as one object so that repetition across game objects is avoided.
For example, when a group of characters within your game all use the same sentences, you can use the Global option to ensure, using the Random, Shuffle, and Step features, that a different sentence will be spoken each time a character speaks.</li>
<li><strong>Game object</strong>: Each instance of the container is treated as a separate entity and therefore no sharing occurs across game objects.</li>
</ul>
