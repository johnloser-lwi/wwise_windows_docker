<h2>Marker Input Mode</h2>
<p>Determines how markers are managed. You can select one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Import From File</strong> to use markers that are saved in the original audio file.</li>
<li><strong>Detect From Transients</strong> to automatically detect transients (onsets) in the audio file and add markers where they are detected. When this option is selected, the detection sensitivity slider is shown. The detection sensitivity controls the sensitivity of the onset detection algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Markers</strong> to manually place markers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When a marker is moved or removed, or a new marker is added, the mode is automatically changed to manual.</p>
<p>Default value: Import From File<br/></p>
