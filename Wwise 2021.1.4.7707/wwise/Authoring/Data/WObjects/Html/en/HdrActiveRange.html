<h2>Active Range</h2>
<p>Defines for each voice the range in decibels, from the sound&rsquo;s peak, for which the HDR dynamics are active. The active range defines the region of interest in a sound, based on its analyzed envelope: it is &ldquo;active&rdquo; as long as the current envelope level is above &ldquo;peak level&rdquo; minus &ldquo;active level&rdquo;. When it is not active, the HDR dynamics do not consider the content of the sound. If the active range is 0, the sound has no influence on the position of the HDR window.</p>
