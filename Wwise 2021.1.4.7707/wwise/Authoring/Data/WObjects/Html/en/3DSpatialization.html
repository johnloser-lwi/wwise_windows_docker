<h2>3D Spatialization</h2>
<p>Specifies whether the positioning of the source is calculated to simulate movement within a 3D space. When set to Position or Position + Orientation, movement of the source is reflected by a sound being heard through specific speakers within the surround environment. With Position + Orientation, the sound&rsquo;s multichannel content also rotates with respect to the relative orientations of the emitter and listener. Orientation only has an effect with multichannel input files, and spread greater than zero.</p>
<p>When set to None, the source is panned according to the Speaker Panning setting.</p>
<p>Default value: None<br/></p>
