<h2>Avoid Repeat</h2>
<p>Determines how many other objects must be played before an object can be repeated.</p>
<p>The behavior of this option is affected by whether you are in Standard or Shuffle mode.</p>
<p>In Standard mode, the object played is selected completely randomly, but the last x objects played are excluded from the list.</p>
<p>In Shuffle mode, when the list is reset, the last x objects played will be excluded from the list.</p>
<p>If you have an unlooped Random Group that is set to shuffle and continuous, the “Avoid repeating last x played” option has no effect on the playback of your group.</p>
<p>This option applies to Random Groups only.</p>
<p>Default value: 1<br/>
Range: 1 to 999<br/></p>
