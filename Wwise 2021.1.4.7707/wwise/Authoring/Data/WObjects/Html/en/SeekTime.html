<h2>Seek Time</h2>
<p>The seek position expressed as an absolute time value. This duration takes looping into account. For example, seeking to 10 seconds of a 10 second sound that loops twice over itself will bring the cursor to the beginning of the second loop.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is impossible to seek after a looping region (in the outro portion) of an infinitely looping sound.</p>
<p>When seeking within a Music Segment, the position is relative to the Entry Cue. It is thus impossible to seek before the Entry Cue (Pre-Entry). However, it is possible to seek after the Exit Cue (Post-Exit) using this option.</p>
<p>Default value: 0<br/>
