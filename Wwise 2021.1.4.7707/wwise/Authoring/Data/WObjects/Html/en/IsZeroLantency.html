<h2>Zero Latency</h2>
<p>Creates a small audio buffer consisting of the beginning portion of the audio file that covers the latency time required to fetch the rest of the file. This enables the entire streamed sound to be played back without delays.</p>
<p>Latency and prefetch settings are set per track. If you have more than one music source per track then the beginning portion of each source will need to be loaded into memory.</p>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
