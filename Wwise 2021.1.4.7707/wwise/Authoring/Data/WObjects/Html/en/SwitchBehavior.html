<h2>Play Mode</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step:</strong> Changes the object only after a new play Event is triggered regardless of whether the Switch changed during playback. This option is useful for one-shot sounds, such as footstep sounds that walk across different surfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous:</strong> Changes the object as soon as a new Switch is detected. When Continuous is selected, a new play Event is not required to change the object that is played. This option is useful for looping sounds, such as snowboarding sounds that switch from snow to ice.</li>
</ul>
