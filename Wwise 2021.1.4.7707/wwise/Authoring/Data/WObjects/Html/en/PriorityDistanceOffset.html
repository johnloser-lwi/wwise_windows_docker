<h2>Offset priority by x at max distance</h2>
<p>Specifies a value by which the priority of an object is offset when it reaches the max distance value specified in the Attenuation Editor.</p>
<p>When selected, an offset is applied to the priority of the object when it falls anywhere within the attenuation max distance value. The amount of offset applied will depend on the object&rsquo;s relative position to the listener.</p>
<p>When this option is not selected, the distance from the listener does not affect the priority of an object.</p>
<p>Default value: -10<br/>
Range: -100 to 100<br/></p>
