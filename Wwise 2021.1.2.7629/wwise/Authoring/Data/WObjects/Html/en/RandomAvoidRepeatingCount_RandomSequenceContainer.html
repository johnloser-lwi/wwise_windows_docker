<h2>Avoid repeating last x played</h2>
<p>Determines how many other objects must be played before an object can be repeated.</p>
<p>The behavior of this option is affected by whether you are in Standard or Shuffle mode.</p>
<p>In Standard mode, the object played is selected completely randomly, but the last x objects played are excluded from the list.</p>
<p>In Shuffle mode, when the container is looped, the last x objects played will be excluded from the list.</p>
<p>If you have a non-looping Random Container that is set to shuffle and continuous, the “Avoid repeating last x played” option has no effect on the playback of your container.</p>
<p>Default value: 1<br/>
Range: 1 to 999<br/></p>
