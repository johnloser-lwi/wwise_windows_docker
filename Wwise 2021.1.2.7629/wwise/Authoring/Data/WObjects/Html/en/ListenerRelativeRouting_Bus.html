<h2>Listener Relative Routing</h2>
<p>When enabled, the emitter-listener association is evaluated at this Wwise object. Emitter-listener associations are typically evaluated for objects of the actor-mixer hierarchy. In the case of busses however, listener relative routing is only desirable when the submix conveyed by this bus represents an independent emitter which needs to be explicitly positioned by the game and 3D spatialized against the listener. Notable use cases are the auxiliary busses associated to Rooms by Wwise Spatial Audio, or the early reflection bus hosting the Wwise Reflect Plug-In.</p>
<p>Refer to the Wwise Spatial Audio documentation for more information on Rooms or Wwise Reflect.</p>
<p>Evaluating emitter-listener association impacts routing, as can be observed in the Voice Graph of the Wwise Profiler.</p>
