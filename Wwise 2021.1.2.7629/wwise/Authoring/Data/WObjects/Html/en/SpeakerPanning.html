<h2>Speaker Panning</h2>
<p>The default is Direct Assignment, where FL maps to FL, FR maps to FR, and so on.</p>
<p>If set to Balance-Fade, allows you to adjust the volume of each channel in a 2.0 to 7.1 Audio Bus. In reference to the Speaker Panner, channels closer to the circle will have their volume increased, while channels further from the circle will have their volume decreased.</p>
<p>If set to Steering, allows you to redistribute the content of the sound&rsquo;s channels amongst the channels of the output bus. The distribution will be weighted towards the circle in the Speaker Panner.</p>
<p>The Panner works independently of the number of channels within the source.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Panner has no effect on an ambisonic sound.</p>
<p>Default value: Direct Assignment<br/></p>
