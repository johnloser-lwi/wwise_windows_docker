<h2>Mode</h2>
<p>Specifies how the sound engine will determine which path to select when there is more than one pre-defined path that matches the States or Switches triggered at runtime.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Match</strong> - Selects the path that best matches the States or Switches that are triggered at runtime. If there is not an exact match, the path with the least amount of wildcards (*) will be selected.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted</strong> - Randomly selects one of the matching paths based on their respective weighting values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several pre-defined paths can match the States or Switches triggered at runtime due to the use of wildcards (*) in fallback paths.</p>
<p>Default value: Best Match<br/></p>
