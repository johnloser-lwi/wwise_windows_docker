<h2>Voice Low-pass Filter</h2>
<p>A recursive filter that attenuates high frequencies based on the value specified.</p>
<p>The units for this filter represent the percentage of low-pass filtering that has been applied, where 0 means no low-pass filtering (signal unaffected) and 100 means maximal attenuation.</p>
