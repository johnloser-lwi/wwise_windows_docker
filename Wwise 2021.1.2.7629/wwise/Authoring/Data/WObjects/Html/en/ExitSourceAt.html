<h2>Exit source at</h2>
<p>Indicates the point in the source at which the exit will be initiated. You can choose from the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate:</strong> The source stops playing immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Next Grid:</strong> The source stops playing at the next grid interval. The grid is an arbitrary method by which music objects can be virtually partitioned.</li>
<li><strong>Next Bar:</strong> The source stops playing at the next bar.</li>
<li><strong>Next Beat:</strong> The source stops playing at the next beat.</li>
<li><strong>Next Cue:</strong> The source stops playing at the next cue, whether it be a custom cue or the exit cue.</li>
<li><strong>Next Custom Cue:</strong> The source stops playing at the next custom cue. If the current segment doesn&rsquo;t contain a custom cue, Wwise continues to the next segment until it finds a custom cue.</li>
<li><strong>Exit Cue:</strong> The source stops playing at the exit cue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When choosing &lsquo;Next Cue&rsquo; or &lsquo;Next Custom Cue&rsquo;, you can define which custom cue name to match. The name must be an exact match. If no name is specified, any custom cue will match.</p>
<p>This option is available for Music Switch Containers only.</p>
<p>Default value: Exit Cue<br/></p>
