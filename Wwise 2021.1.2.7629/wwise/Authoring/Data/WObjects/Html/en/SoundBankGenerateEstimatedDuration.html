<p>Attempts to determine the expected duration of each Event in a SoundBank. For each event, a DurationType, MinDuration, and MaxDurations attribute will be included in the soundbanksinfo.xml file. The DurationType may be one of: &ldquo;OneShot&rdquo;, &ldquo;Infinite&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mixed&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo;. &ldquo;OneShot&rdquo; indicates a non-looping sound; &ldquo;Infinite&rdquo;, a looping sound; &ldquo;Mixed&rdquo;, a sound which may or may not loop infinitely (possibly based on random chance or a Switch), and &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; indicates that Wwise was not able to determine the duration. The MinDuration and MaxDuration attributes attempt to place a lower and upper bound on the duration of an event. Note that these bounds are only an estimate and may or may not be accurate depending on runtime conditions.</p>
