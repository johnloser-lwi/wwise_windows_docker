<h2>Cone Attenuation</h2>
<p>Creates a sound cone where attenuation is controlled using a series of cones with varying angles. The direction of the cone-shaped boundaries are ultimately controlled by the orientation of the game object.</p>
<p>The cone attenuation value is added to the distance-based attenuation values.</p>
<p>Default value: No<br/></p>
