<h2>Render Effect</h2>
<p>Determines whether the selected Effect instance is rendered before being packaged into SoundBanks.</p>
<p>Rendering Effects prior to packaging into SoundBanks can save on processing power during gameplay. However, it also limits the interactivity with game play because RTPCs can&rsquo;t be used when the Render option is selected.</p>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
