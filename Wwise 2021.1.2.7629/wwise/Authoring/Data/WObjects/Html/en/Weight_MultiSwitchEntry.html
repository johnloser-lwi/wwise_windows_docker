<h2>Weight</h2>
<p>The likelihood that the path will be selected in the case where there are other matching paths.</p>
<p>When a matching path has a weight of 100, other matching paths with a weight below 100 are automatically discarded. When a matching path has a weight of 0, it is discarded unless all other matching paths also have a weight of 0.</p>
<p>This option only applies when the Dialogue Event is in &lsquo;Weighted&rsquo; mode.</p>
