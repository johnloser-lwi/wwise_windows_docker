<h2>Enable Height Spread</h2>
<p>Height Spread automatically computes a minimal spread based on elevation, if and only if panning occurs on a planar configuration, or based on negative elevation alone if panning occurs on hemispherical configurations like 7.1.4. This helps smooth out panning when 3D sounds pass above or below the listener.</p>
<p>Height Spread is always enabled by default even if a sound doesn&rsquo;t have an attenuation. Height Spread can only be disabled by deselecting this property. If a sound doesn&rsquo;t have an attenuation, and you would like to disable Height Spread, an Attenuation ShareSet with a constant Output Bus Volume must be created specifically for this purpose.</p>

<p>Default value: true<br/></p>
