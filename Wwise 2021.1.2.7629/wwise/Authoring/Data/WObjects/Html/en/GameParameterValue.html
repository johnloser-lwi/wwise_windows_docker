<p>The target value for the Game Parameter. The way in which the value is modified depends on whether the value is absolute or relative.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The default slider range is limited. You can go over those limits by entering the value directly, or by rolling the mouse while the focus is on the edit control.</p>
