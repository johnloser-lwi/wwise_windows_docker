<p><strong>Note</strong>: These options are only available if the <strong>Send to virtual voice</strong> option is enabled.</p>
<p>Determines the behavior of objects that move from the virtual voice list back to the physical voice.</p>
<p><strong>You can select one of the following options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play from beginning</strong> to play the object from its beginning. This option resets the object&rsquo;s loop count.</li>
<li><strong>Play from elapsed time</strong> to continue playing the object as if it had never stopped playing. This option is not sample accurate, so sounds returning to the physical voice may be out of sync with other sounds playing.</li>
<li><strong>Resume</strong> to pause the object when it moves from the physical voice to the virtual voice list and then resume playback when it moves back to the physical voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: Play from elapsed time<br/></p>
