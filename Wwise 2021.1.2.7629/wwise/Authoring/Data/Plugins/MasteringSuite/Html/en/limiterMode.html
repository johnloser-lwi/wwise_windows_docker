<h2>Limiter Mode</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hard-Knee Limiter: Audio signals will be cut off at the threshold value.</li>
<li>Soft-Knee Limiter: Temporarily allow the threshold to be exceeded, and gradually change the audio signal back and forth to the threshold level over the specified attack and release times.</li>
<li>Advanced Limiter: Automatically configure the attack and react to peaks smoothly before the input reaches the threshold, with introduction of a 2.67ms latency. The signal is kept under the threshold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: Soft<br/></p>
