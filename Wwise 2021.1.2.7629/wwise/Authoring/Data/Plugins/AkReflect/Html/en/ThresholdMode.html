<h2>Threshold Mode</h2>
<p>Continous mode allows for a maximum tolerable Doppler pitch shift caused by movement. If movement is fast enough to exceed the threshold, the volume of the reflection will be ducked until the pitch returns to below the threshold. A threshold of 0 will cause the volume of the reflection to be ducked any time movement occurs.</p>
<p>Step mode allows for a distance threshold &lsquo;bubble&rsquo;, where reflections are not updated until a minimum amount of displacement occurs. A threshold of 0 will cause
Reflect to crossfade between the old and new reflections whenever movement occurs. Crossfading will result in time stretching effects that do not modify pitch.</p>
<p>Default value: Continuous<br/></p>
