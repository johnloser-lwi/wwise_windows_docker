<h2>Q Factor</h2>
<p>The peakiness or sharpness of the deflector&rsquo;s resonance curve. Q factor is inversely related to bandwidth, so a large Q factor results in a narrow bandwidth and a small Q factor results in a wide bandwidth.</p>
<p>A high Q factor value should be used to simulate regular or round surfaces, whereas a low Q factor value should be used to simulate irregular surfaces.</p>
<p>Default value: 10.0<br/>
Range: 0.1 to 50<br/></p>
