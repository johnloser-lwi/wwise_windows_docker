<h2>Quality</h2>
<p>A value indicating the percentage of analysis modes to preserve in the synthesis. Synthesis using lower percentages may yield less audio fidelity but increases performance of the synthesis algorithm. A value of 0% means that the minimum number of modes is preserved and a value of 100% means that all modes are preserved.</p>
<p>Default value: 100<br/>
Range: 0 to 100<br/>
Units: % <br/></p>
