<h2>Voice Enable</h2>
<p>Determines whether a given pitch voice is enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In order to avoid unnecessary artifacts and save resources, make sure you disable all voices that you don&rsquo;t need (instead of using a zero pitch or a very low voice level for example).</p>
<p>Default value: false<br/></p>
