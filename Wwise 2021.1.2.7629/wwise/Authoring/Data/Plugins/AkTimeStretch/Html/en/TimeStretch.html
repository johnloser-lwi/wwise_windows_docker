<h2>Time Stretch</h2>
<p>Percentage of original sound duration. 100% corresponds to no Time Stretch while 200% is twice as long. Similarly time compression is possible using 50% to get the sound at half the duration. This value supports RTPC and may be smoothly changed during playback without additional artifacts.</p>
<p>Default value: 100<br/>
Range: 25 to 1600<br/>
Units: % of original duration <br/></p>
