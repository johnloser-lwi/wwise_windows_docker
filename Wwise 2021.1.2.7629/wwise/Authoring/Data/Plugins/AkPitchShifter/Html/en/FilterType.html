<h2>Filter Type</h2>
<p>Determines the type of filtering that can be applied to the transposed (wet) signal. The following filters are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>None</strong> to disable the filter.</li>
<li><strong>Low Pass</strong> to provide a fixed sloped attenuation of high frequencies from a specified frequency. Below this point the signal is almost unaffected but higher frequencies are progressively more attenuated past the cutoff frequency point.</li>
<li><strong>High Pass</strong> to provide a fixed slope attenuation of low frequencies from a specified frequency. Above this point the signal is almost unaffected while lower frequencies are progressively more attenuated below the cutoff frequency point.</li>
<li><strong>Band Pass</strong> to reject all frequencies around the specified center frequency. The range of frequencies around the center is controlled by the Q.</li>
<li><strong>Notch</strong> to provide a fixed attenuation of a specified frequency range with a varying width. The range of frequencies around the center is controlled by the Q.</li>
<li><strong>Low Shelf</strong> to provide gain/attenuation for a specified range of low frequencies. This curve type is also known as Bass Tone Control.</li>
<li><strong>High Shelf</strong> to provide gain /attenuation for a specified range of high frequencies. This curve type is also known as Treble Tone Control.</li>
<li><strong>Peaking</strong> to provide amplification/attenuation of a specified frequency range with a varying width. The range of frequencies around the peak is controlled by the Q.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: None<br/></p>
