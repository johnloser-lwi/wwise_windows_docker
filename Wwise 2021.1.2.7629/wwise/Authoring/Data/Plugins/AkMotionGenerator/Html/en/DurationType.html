<h2>Duration Type</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>One period</strong>: Specifies that the duration of the motion effect will be one period, where a period is defined as being equal to the period multiplied by the period multiplier. For example, let&rsquo;s say your period is set to 2 and the period multiplier is set to 3. If you select “One period” as the duration, the motion effect will play for 6 seconds (2x3). When “One period” is selected, the motion effect completes one cycle of the curve.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed duration</strong>: Specifies a fixed duration for the motion effect. Depending on the value specified for the “Duration”, the motion effect may complete any number of curve cycles. If the fixed duration value is not a multiple of the period multiplied by the period multiplier, the last curve cycle will be incomplete.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope</strong>: Enables ADSR amplitude envelope controls for the motion curve. Depending on the values specified for the ADSR properties, the motion effect may complete any number of curve cycles. If the overall duration of the ADSR envelope is not a multiple of the period multiplied by the period multiplier, the last curve cycle will be incomplete.</li>
</ul>
