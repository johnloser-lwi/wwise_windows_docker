<h2>Oversampling</h2>
<p>The rate at which the control curves used for positioning and distance-based attenuation are sampled.</p>
<p>Woosh is typically used for very short sounds, often less than 1 second. As a result, you may need to use the Oversampling control to run the control curves and position along the path at a higher rate than the regular buffer period, which is approximately 21 ms on most platforms. This effectively brings the control rate down by the oversampling value. For example, a control rate oversampling of 8 will result in a sampling of control curves to happen every 2.63 ms (~21 ms/8).</p>
<p>Oversampling represents a computational cost and is best used only when needed.</p>
