<h2>Random</h2>
<p>A positive and negative offset applied to the corresponding property value that defines a range of possible values for the property. For example, adding a random value of 1 to a property value would mean that the possible range for that property would be [(value - 1) to (value +1)].</p>
<p>When defining a Random value, Wwise randomly selects a value from within the range (value +/- random) each time the wind sound is played.</p>
<p>Default value: 0.0<br/>
Range: 0 to 48.0<br/></p>
