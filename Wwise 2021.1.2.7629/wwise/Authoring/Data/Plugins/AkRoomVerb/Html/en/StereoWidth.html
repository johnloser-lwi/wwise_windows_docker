<h2>Stereo Width</h2>
<p>Determines the similarity between the ER + reverb content that is output in the left channels (front and/or rear) and right channels (front and/or rear). This can create a stronger sense of space, by enlarging the stereo spread of the early reflections and the reverberation.</p>
<p>When a value of zero is used, the ER + reverb output to the left and right channels is the same. As a result, some memory and CPU optimization can be obtained. A value of 180 means that an entirely different ER + reverb signal is fed to each side. This effect is stronger when monitored over headphones due to the absence of cross-talk between speaker signals which diminishes the Effect.</p>
<p>This property has no effect on 1.0 (mono) or 1.1 channel sounds.</p>
