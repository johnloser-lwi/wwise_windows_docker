<h2>Filter Band Insert</h2>
<p>Determines the point in the signal chain at which filters are applied. The following insertion points are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Off</strong>: No filter is applied.</li>
<li><strong>ER only</strong>: Applies the filter to the early reflection portion of the signal.</li>
<li><strong>Reverb only</strong>: Applies the filter to the reverb tail portion of the signal.</li>
<li><strong>ER + Reverb</strong>: Applies the filter to both the early reflection and reverb tail portions of the signal.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the Early reflections option is not selected, the ER component will always be ignored no matter which insertion point is selected.</p>
<p>Default value: ER + Reverb<br/></p>
