<h2>Room Shape</h2>
<p>Determines the perceived coloration of the reverb by controlling (along with the Density property) the delay lengths used by the algorithm while maintaining a constant modal density. In general, a high room shape setting will mean less divergence between the longest and shortest delay lengths. This could be analogous to a regularly shaped room, a cube for instance. At lower room shape settings, the divergence between delay lines is larger.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you experiment with different Room shape settings for each Density value.</p>
